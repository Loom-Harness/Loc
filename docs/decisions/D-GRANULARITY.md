# D-GRANULARITY — storage bindings are per-context, not per-aggregate

**Status:** PINNED.

**Problem.** Two proposals disagree:

- `storage-and-platform-config.md` §3.3 + §3.2 commits to **per-aggregate**
  binding (`for: Sales.Order`), and §2.1 invariant 4 explicitly
  declares "BC = semantic boundary only … no storage homogeneity."
- `bounded-context-model.md` reframes the BC as the unit that owns
  framework + storage, with per-aggregate binding deferred to v2 as
  override-only.

**Decision.** **Per-context for v1, all kinds.** A `dataSource`
binds at granularity `(context, kind)`. All aggregates in a context
share the same primary store (state or eventLog), the same derived
stores (cache, snapshot, replica), and the same per-kind config
(snapshot policy, cache TTL, …) for that context.

Per-aggregate binding is **deferred to v2** as an override mechanism
for the rare cross-infra-within-one-context case. The storage
proposal's per-aggregate `for: <Aggregate>` syntax does not land in
v1; if reintroduced later it lands as a deferred override (not the
primary form).

**Rationale.**

- Transactional feasibility (the "which writes can co-commit?"
  chain) is naturally per-context — see `bounded-context-model.md`
  §"Transactional workflow feasibility" link 3.
- Real-world v1 cases overwhelmingly have one primary store per
  context; cross-aggregate-within-one-context infra splits are rare.
- Per-context-per-kind preserves the storage proposal's most
  valuable insight (different kinds *do* live in different physical
  engines — eventLog in Kafka, snapshot in Redis), without
  multiplying the binding surface.
- v2 per-aggregate override remains compatible: it lifts the
  granularity inside one context without changing the rest of the
  model. The storage proposal's grammar work survives there.

**Validator rules implied.**

- `dataSource.for:` references a context, never an aggregate.
  Parser/validator rejects an aggregate-qualified `for:` in v1 with
  a diagnostic that links to this decision.
- "Two aggregates in the same context bind to different physical
  stores" is unrepresentable in v1.
- ES + state-based aggregates may coexist in one context, each
  resolving to the context's `kind: eventLog` or `kind: state`
  dataSource respectively.

**Affects.**

- `storage-and-platform-config.md` — §2.1 invariant 4 ("BC = semantic
  boundary only") rewritten to "BC = transactional-feasibility unit;
  storage homogeneity per BC is the v1 default"; §3.3 ("`for:`
  reference syntax") rewritten to context-only.
- `bounded-context-model.md` — §"Per-aggregate storage" still
  accurately frames v1 + v2; this decision pins it.
